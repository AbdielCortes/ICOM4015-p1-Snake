## Advanced Programming Project 1 - The World Snake

The classic snake game with a *Jojo's Biazzare Adventure: Stardust Crusaders* twist 
added to it.Your goal is to eat as many apples (red squares) as possible without 
crashing into yourself; when you crash into walls you appear on the opposite side.

When you eat the Za Warudo power up (black square) your snake slows down 
for 9 seconds, making it easier to eat the apple. The snake and the apple
change color, and a sound effect plays when you eat the power up.

If you take too long to reach the apple it will rot, causing you to loose poins
when you eat it.
